## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot in making this project, as it was the first responsive web design I've ever attempted to implement. Mainly I had a lot of practice with positioning elements, flexbox, and targeting html elements in css.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to be able to implement different pages of a site and the functionality to navigate to and from them. Additionally, I would like to learn other frameworks to create interesting and attractive backgrounds and effects using javascript that I can ultimately use in creating my portfolio website.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Self-explanatory. Google helped me countless times in researching how to tackle issues I would run into.
- [cssTricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Very helpful resource in explaining the use of flexbox, it's different attributes, and whether to use them on the parent or children.
